                        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                         I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                          They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                           The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                             In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
